            Going south for the Winter? Going on a long trip? Are you leaving your coastal home for the winter? Do you own a second home? Don't
            worry about what might happen to your house while you are gone.  We know any unexpected issue at your home can be costly if not
            addressed right away. Let us help put your mind at ease. <span class="bold">New Jersey Home Watch</span> is here for you. We will
            personally inspect your home in your absence for any damage or potential problem and will provide you with a complete report of our findings.

            You no longer need to rely on your neighbors or friends to get your mail, water your plants, pick up your packages, or supervise access to your property for contractors or repairmen. We can do that, too! We are fully licensed, insured, bonded, and accredited with the National Home Watch Association.
