            Jackie and Willie have resided in New Jersey for 35 years. Together they have owned several homes in Middlesex and Monmouth county and
            have spent a considerable amount of time “down the shore”. Having raised two daughters, they are now looking to bring peace of mind to
            Monmouth and Ocean County homeowners that may leave their homes for an extended period of time or close up their beach house for the
            winter. They also offer services for Airbnb or VRBO homeowners that need someone to watch their most precious asset&mdash;their home.
